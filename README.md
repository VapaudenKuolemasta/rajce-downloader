## How to use
    
#### Allowed formats for `--url` option. 
```
userName
https://userName.rajce.idnes.cz
https://userName.rajce.idnes.cz/albumName
"https://username.rajce.idnes.cz/albumName/?login=login&code=password"
```
You can use multiple urls and userNames. Quotes are required when URL has album credentials.

#### Using `--analyze` flag.  
By default, `ALBUM_TOP_SIZE` = 10 and `MEDIA_TOP_SIZE` = 50.  
So, `-a` without any extra parameters is the same as `-a 10 50`.  
Few examples:  
Show albums Top3 and photos Top10 - `-a 3 10`.  
Show only photos Top13 - `-a 0 13`  
```
NOTE! When you use --analyze flag script will not download files
```

#### Bruteforce flag `-b`
Trying to access password protected albums with all combinations of userName and albumName as credentials. 
Don't overuse this flag, you can be banned. 
Better apply this flag for single album test.
